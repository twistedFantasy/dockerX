# ELK-Stack
"ELK" is the acronym for three open source projects: Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
Elasticsearch is a search and analytics engine. Logstash is a serverâ€‘side data processing
pipeline that ingests data from multiple sources simultaneously, transforms it, and then
sends it to a "stash" like Elasticsearch. Kibana lets users visualize data with charts
and graphs in Elasticsearch.
